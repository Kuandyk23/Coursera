    "1. The boxplot for median home values shows that there are some outliers, indicating potential variations in home prices across different neighborhoods.\n",

    "2. The histogram for the Charles River variable suggests that a majority of houses in the dataset are not located on the river.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The boxplot comparison between median home values (MEDV) and house age (AGE) indicates that older houses tend to have lower median values, although there are exceptions.\n",

    "4. The scatter plot for nitric oxides concentration (NOX) and the proportion of non-retail business acres (INDUS) does not show a clear linear relationship between the two variables.\n",
